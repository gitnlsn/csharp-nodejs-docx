INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSERTING A TABLE BETWEEN "BUSINESS CONTEXT" AND "SCOPE" SECTIONS

OBJECTIVE:
Extract all text between the "Business Context" and "Scope" headers in a Word document,
replace this content with a formatted table, and provide both the extracted text and the modified document.

PREREQUISITES:
- A Word document containing "Business Context" and "Scope" headers
- The document will be provided in Base64 encoded format

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. PREPARE THE DOCUMENT
   - Receive the encoded document
   - Convert it to a usable format
   - Verify the document is valid before proceeding

2. LOCATE THE KEY SECTIONS
   - Find the "Business Context" heading in the document
   - Find the "Scope" heading that follows it
   - Identify all content located between these two headings

3. EXTRACT THE CONTENT
   - Save all paragraphs of text found between the two headings
   - Note their formatting to maintain document consistency
   - Keep a record of where these paragraphs were located

4. REMOVE THE ORIGINAL CONTENT
   - Remove all the paragraphs that were between the headings
   - Maintain the document structure without these paragraphs

5. CREATE AND INSERT A TABLE
   - Create a new table with 2 columns
   - Add a header row with cells labeled "id" and "value"
   - Add two data rows with sample content:
     * Row 1: "A" and "robo"
     * Row 2: "B" and "carro"
   - Format the table using an appropriate style from the document
   - Add borders to all cells of the table
   - Set the table to an appropriate width
   - Insert the table after the "Business Context" heading

6. FINALIZE THE RESULTS
   - Compile all the extracted text paragraphs
   - Save the changes to the document
   - Return both the extracted text and the modified document

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- The headings must match "Business Context" and "Scope" exactly
- Look for headings at outline level 2 (typically Heading 2 style)
- The table should use a style that matches the document's existing styles
- If no table styles exist in the document, use a standard style like "TableGrid"
- The table should be properly sized and formatted for the document
- All extracted text should be preserved and returned, even if none is found

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Headers might be missing or in unexpected formats
- Document might have no existing table styles to reference
- Table might need to be resized based on document dimensions
- Complex document formatting might affect table appearance
- Always validate inputs and outputs to ensure successful processing
