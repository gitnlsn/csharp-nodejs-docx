INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXTRACTING PARAGRAPHS BETWEEN "BUSINESS CONTEXT" AND "SCOPE"

OBJECTIVE:
Extract all text paragraphs that are located between the "Business Context" 
header and the "Scope" header in a DOCX document.

REQUIRED TOOLS:
- Capability to process DOCX documents
- A location to store the extracted paragraphs (list or array)

DETAILED STEPS:

1. OPEN THE DOCUMENT
   - Load the DOCX document for processing
   - Prepare a structure to store the extracted paragraphs
   - Verify that the document is valid before proceeding

2. INITIALIZE CONTROL VARIABLES
   - Create a boolean variable "inBusinessContextSection" (initially false)
   - Prepare an empty list to store the found paragraphs
   - Consider adding a counter to track the number of extracted paragraphs

3. ITERATE THROUGH ALL PARAGRAPHS IN THE DOCUMENT
   - For each paragraph in the document body:
     * Determine if it is a heading or a normal paragraph
     * Examine all the text in the paragraph, not just the beginning
     * Process each paragraph completely before moving to the next

4. IDENTIFY SECTION HEADINGS WITH PRECISION
   - For each paragraph, rigorously check:
     * If it is a heading (check style, formatting, and outline level)
     * If the text contains EXACTLY "Business Context" (consider case sensitivity)
     * If the text contains EXACTLY "Scope" (consider case sensitivity)
     * Avoid partial matches that could cause false positives
     * Consider using exact whole word matching, not substrings

5. CONTROL THE CAPTURE STATE WITH PRECISION
   - If a "Business Context" heading is found:
     * Set the "inBusinessContextSection" variable to true
     * Record the position or index where the capture started
     * Continue to the next paragraph
   - If a "Scope" heading is found and currently capturing:
     * Set the "inBusinessContextSection" variable to false
     * Record the position or index where the capture ended
     * End the capture
   - Make sure not to lose track of the state if there are nested headings

6. CAPTURE THE RELEVANT PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY
   - If "inBusinessContextSection" is true and the current element is a normal paragraph:
     * Extract all the text from the paragraph (including all text content)
     * Verify that the text is not empty after removing whitespace
     * Add the complete text to the array of captured paragraphs
     * Maintain the original text formatting, if necessary
     * Ignore paragraphs that are headings, even if they are in the captured section

7. PROCESS THE CAPTURED PARAGRAPHS
   - After iterating through all paragraphs in the document:
     * Verify that there is captured content (the list is not empty)
     * Validate that the captured paragraphs make sense (not too short or too long)
     * Return the captured paragraphs in the desired format

IMPORTANT POINTS:
- Headings typically have different formatting than normal paragraphs
- All text within a paragraph should be captured, even if divided into parts
- The process should ignore other elements such as tables or images
- Check headings considering exactly "Business Context" and "Scope", not approximations
- If a heading contains additional text (e.g., "Business Context Analysis"), it should NOT be considered
- Pay attention to different formatting variations that might be used for headings

ERROR HANDLING:
- Verify that the document was opened correctly before attempting to process it
- Handle cases where none of the headings are found (return a specific error)
- Handle cases where only one of the headings is found (check initial vs. final heading)
- Confirm that there is content between the specified headings (alert if empty)
- Capture and record any exceptions during processing with error details
- Implement a timeout to prevent processing from hanging on very large documents
