INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING A NEW ITEM TO AN EXISTING LIST AFTER "IN SCOPE" HEADING

OBJECTIVE:
Find a numbered list following the "In Scope" heading in a Word document, 
add a new item to the end of that list, and return both the list of items and the modified document.

PREREQUISITES:
- A Word document containing an "In Scope" heading
- A numbered list following that heading
- The document will be provided in Base64 encoded format

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. PREPARE THE DOCUMENT
   - Receive the encoded document
   - Convert it to a usable format
   - Verify the document is valid before proceeding

2. LOCATE THE "IN SCOPE" SECTION
   - Search through the document for a heading or paragraph containing "In Scope"
   - Check all paragraphs, not just headings, as formatting may vary
   - Once found, note the position to begin searching for the list

3. IDENTIFY THE NUMBERED LIST
   - Starting from the "In Scope" heading, look for paragraphs with numbering properties
   - Determine the numbering ID of the first list item found
   - Continue collecting list items with the same numbering ID
   - Stop when finding a paragraph with different numbering or no numbering
   - Record the text of each list item for later reference

4. CREATE THE NEW LIST ITEM
   - Clone the last existing list item to preserve formatting and numbering
   - Remove any existing text content from the cloned item
   - Add the new text content ("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...")
   - Ensure the new list item maintains the same style and numbering sequence

5. INSERT THE NEW ITEM
   - Add the new list item immediately after the last existing list item
   - Verify that the numbering sequence is maintained
   - Ensure the document structure remains intact

6. FINALIZE THE RESULTS
   - Save all changes to the document
   - Prepare a list of all items (including the newly added one)
   - Return both the list of items and the modified document

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- The "In Scope" text must be identified accurately, regardless of case
- Only modify the first numbered list found after the "In Scope" heading
- Preserve all formatting and numbering properties of the original list
- The new item should appear to be a natural continuation of the list
- Handle documents where no list or no "In Scope" heading is found

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Documents with multiple "In Scope" headings
- Complex document structures with nested lists
- Different list formatting or numbering styles
- Lists that continue after interruptions (like comments or images)
- Always validate inputs and outputs to ensure successful processing
