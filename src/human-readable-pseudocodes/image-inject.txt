INSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTING IMAGES BETWEEN "BUSINESS CONTEXT" AND "SCOPE" SECTIONS

OBJECTIVE:
Extract all text between the "Business Context" and "Scope" headers in a Word document, 
replace this content with an image, and provide both the extracted text and the modified document.

PREREQUISITES:
- A Word document containing "Business Context" and "Scope" headers
- An image to insert between these sections
- Both document and image will be provided in Base64 encoded format

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. PREPARE THE DATA
   - Receive the encoded document and image
   - Convert them to a usable format
   - Check that both are valid before proceeding

2. LOCATE THE KEY SECTIONS
   - Find the "Business Context" heading in the document
   - Find the "Scope" heading that follows it
   - Identify all content located between these two headings

3. EXTRACT THE CONTENT
   - Save all paragraphs of text found between the two headings
   - Note their formatting to maintain document consistency
   - Keep a record of where these paragraphs were located

4. MODIFY THE DOCUMENT
   - Remove all the paragraphs that were between the headings
   - Insert the provided image after the "Business Context" heading
   - Ensure the image is properly sized and positioned
   - Apply appropriate formatting consistent with the document style

5. FINALIZE THE RESULTS
   - Compile all the extracted text paragraphs
   - Save the changes to the document
   - Return both the extracted text and the modified document

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- The headings must match "Business Context" and "Scope" exactly
- Look for headings at outline level 2 (typically Heading 2 style)
- Preserve document formatting and structure
- The image should be properly sized for the document
- All extracted text should be preserved, even if none is found

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Headers might be missing or in unexpected formats
- Document might have complex formatting or structure
- Large documents or images may require additional processing time
- Always validate inputs and outputs to ensure successful processing
