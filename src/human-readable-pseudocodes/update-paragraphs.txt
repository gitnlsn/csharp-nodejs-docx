INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING PARAGRAPHS BETWEEN "BUSINESS CONTEXT" AND "SCOPE" SECTIONS

OBJECTIVE:
Find all paragraphs between the "Business Context" and "Scope" headers in a Word document,
modify their content by adding a prefix to each paragraph, and return the modified document.

PREREQUISITES:
- A Word document containing "Business Context" and "Scope" headers
- The document will be provided in Base64 encoded format

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. PREPARE THE DOCUMENT
   - Receive the encoded document
   - Convert it to a usable format
   - Verify the document is valid before proceeding

2. LOCATE THE KEY SECTIONS
   - Find the "Business Context" heading in the document
   - Find the "Scope" heading that follows it
   - Identify all paragraphs located between these two headings

3. MODIFY THE PARAGRAPHS
   - For each paragraph found between the headings:
     * Extract the current text content
     * Add a prefix like "UPDATED: " to the beginning of the text
     * Replace the original text with the modified version
     * Maintain all formatting and paragraph properties
   - Keep track of all paragraphs that were modified
   - Preserve the original document structure

4. VERIFY MODIFICATIONS
   - Check that all targeted paragraphs were successfully updated
   - Ensure no other parts of the document were altered
   - Verify that document formatting remains intact

5. FINALIZE THE RESULTS
   - Save all changes to the document
   - Convert the modified document back to Base64 format
   - Return the modified document and a count of updated paragraphs

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- The headings must match "Business Context" and "Scope" exactly
- Look for headings at outline level 2 (typically Heading 2 style)
- Only modify paragraphs, not other elements like tables or lists
- Preserve all formatting, styles, and properties of the paragraphs
- Handle documents where no paragraphs exist between the specified headers
- Process all text within a paragraph, including text with different formatting

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Headers might be missing or in unexpected formats
- Paragraphs might contain complex formatting or embedded objects
- Text modifications might affect document layout
- Text might contain special characters that need proper handling
- Always validate inputs and outputs to ensure successful processing
