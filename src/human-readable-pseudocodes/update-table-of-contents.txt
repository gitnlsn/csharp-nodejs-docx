INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING TABLE OF CONTENTS WITH A NEW ENTRY

OBJECTIVE:
Modify the Table of Contents in a Word document by adding a new entry
between the "Business Context" and "Scope" entries, and return the modified document.

PREREQUISITES:
- A Word document containing a Table of Contents with "Business Context" and "Scope" entries
- The document will be provided in Base64 encoded format

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. PREPARE THE DOCUMENT
   - Receive the encoded document
   - Convert it to a usable format
   - Verify the document is valid before proceeding

2. LOCATE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS
   - Find the Table of Contents structure in the document
   - Verify that it contains the required entries
   - Identify all paragraphs within the Table of Contents

3. FIND THE TARGET ENTRIES
   - Search for the "Business Context" entry (labeled as 1.2)
   - Search for the "Scope" entry (labeled as 1.3)
   - Confirm that both entries exist and are in the expected order
   - Store references to these entries for insertion positioning

4. CREATE THE NEW TOC ENTRY
   - Create a new entry titled "Implementation Approach" with number "1.2.5"
   - Use the same formatting as existing TOC entries
   - Include all necessary elements:
     * Section number (1.2.5)
     * Tab character
     * Entry title (Implementation Approach)
     * Page reference (with appropriate field codes)
   - Ensure the entry matches the style of the existing TOC entries

5. INSERT THE NEW ENTRY
   - Place the new entry between the "Business Context" and "Scope" entries
   - Verify that the TOC structure remains intact
   - Ensure all formatting and field codes are properly applied

6. FINALIZE THE RESULTS
   - Save all changes to the document
   - Convert the modified document back to Base64 format
   - Return the modified document with a success message

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- The Table of Contents structure is complex and contains field codes
- The entries must be identified precisely by both number and name (1.2 Business Context)
- All formatting and styles must be preserved to maintain document consistency
- Field codes for page references must be properly structured
- The document may have multiple TOCs or custom TOC formatting

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Table of Contents might be missing or have an unexpected structure
- Target entries might not be found or might have different numbering
- Field codes and formatting are complex and must be precisely maintained
- The document might use custom TOC styles or formatting
- Always validate inputs and outputs to ensure successful processing
